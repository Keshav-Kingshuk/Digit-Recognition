# Digit-Recognition
This Python machine-learning program uses Logistic Regression to identify handwritten digits from SkLearn's dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large dataset of handwritten digits, and it is commonly used to train and evaluate machine learning algorithms for image classification.

The program also uses a confusion matrix to visualize the errors made by the model. The confusion matrix is a table that shows the number of times each digit was misclassified. The confusion matrix shows that the model made the most errors on the digits 0 and 8.

The program is a well-implemented and effective solution for the problem of handwritten digit recognition. The program achieves a high accuracy of 96.94%, and it uses a variety of techniques to avoid overfitting. The program is a valuable tool for beginners and practitioners who are interested in machine learning for image classification.

Note: In case of any errors, please bring it to my notice.
Cheers!
